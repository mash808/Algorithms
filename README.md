### Maths Background

#### Asymptote
* Approaches but never touches as approaches infinity

### Algorithms

#### General
* Worried about performance of an algorithm (running time & memory space)
  * Time and space complexity
* If measuring time algorithm has taken (or space data structure takes up in memory), can vary from machine to machine

#### Asymptotic Notation
* Can categorise the growth rates of algorithms with regard to the input
  * Allows us to compare different algorithm's efficiency to solve a problem

* Before n<sub>0</sub> doesn't matter
* Usually interested in worst-case, the upper bound (Big-Oh) i.e. doesn't exceed bounding function
* Differ by some constant amount, which gets smaller and smaller as the input grows larger

#### Common Growth Rates
* N = input
